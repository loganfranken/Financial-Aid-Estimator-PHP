# Financial Aid Estimator (PHP)

Open-source PHP Financial Aid Estimator, including an implementation of the Federal Expected Family Contribution
(EFC) formula.

Given the variation in how each university calculates financial aid eligibility, this project does not directly
include logic for estimating financial aid at a particular university. Instead, the PHP Financial Aid Estimator
provides tools to _support_ creating a financial aid estimator specific to each institution's financial aid
methodology.
